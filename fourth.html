      <h1>About Elite 11</h1>

      <p>
        Elite 11 is a football shop built for players who care about performance,
        comfort, and confidence on the pitch. We deliver quality football equipment
        at affordable prices — because great gear should be available to everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        We started in <strong>2025</strong> with one simple goal: make it easier
        for players to find the right football equipment without paying crazy prices.
        From boots and balls to gloves and accessories, we focus on products that
        help you perform at your best.
      </p>

      <h2>Made by a Player</h2>

      <p>
        Elite 11 was created by a football player — someone who understands the game
        from inside the pitch. We know what players look for, what matters during
        training, and what performs under match pressure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you are training daily, playing weekend matches, or just starting
        your football journey, the right equipment makes a real difference.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Believe</h2>

      <p>
        Football is more than just a game. It is discipline, teamwork, ambition,
        and constant improvement. We believe every player deserves access to
        equipment that supports their progress and confidence.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Promise</h2>

      <p>
        Our promise is simple: quality products, fair pricing, and a smooth shopping
        experience. As Elite 11 continues to grow, we aim to expand our collections,
        improve our service, and stay focused on what matters most — the players.
      </p>

      <p class="about-highlight">
        Thank you for being part of Elite 11. We are here to help you step onto the
        pitch prepared, confident, and ready to perform.
